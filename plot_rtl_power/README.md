# plot_rtl_power


Save the output of rtl_power to a PNG heatmap image

The three positional arguments (namely frequencies, interval and duration) are passed straight to `rtl_power`.

The script uses [heatmap.py](https://github.com/keenerd/rtl-sdr-misc).
Change the last line in the script to point it to the correct path.
